# belly-button-challenge

This module is due on 1/22/2025 at midnight. 

In this module, I built an interactive dashboard using the provided Belly Button Biodiversity dataset. The dashboard uses a dropdown to select a sample. Then based on the lesson in 15.3, I made a github pages to access the code. Originally, the github pages only showed my readme file so I had to recreate my repository to recreate the github pages.
